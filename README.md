### NixOS and Home Manager configuration

This is my personal [NixOS][1] and [Home Manager][2] configuration. I'm fairly inexperienced with nix, NixOS and Home Manager, so there may be parts of this configuration that are not idiomatic. You have been warned! NixOS is not my daily driver yet. However, I want to migrate from my current [Arch Linux and dotfiles][3] setup to NixOS because I would like to have more consistency when I switch between different developer boxes at home or in the office.
